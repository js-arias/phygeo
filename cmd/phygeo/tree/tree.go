In PhyGeo, phylogenetic trees must be time-calibrated and stored in a
tab-delimited file. The advantage of using a tab-delimited file is that it
would be easier to manipulate trees than in traditional newick files; for
example, it would be easier for commands in PhyGeo, as well as for third-party
applications, to understand the node IDs.

The recommended way to interact with time-calibrated trees in a PhyGeo project
is by using the commands in "phygeo tree".
	
A PhyGeo tree file is a tab-delimited file with the following columns:
	
	-tree    for the name of the tree.
	-node    for the ID of the node.
	-parent  for of ID of the parent node (-1 is used for the root).
	-age     the age of the node (in years).
	-taxon   the taxonomic name of the node.
	
Here is an example file:

	# time calibrated phylogenetic tree
	tree	node	parent	age	taxon
	dinosaurs	0	-1	235000000
	dinosaurs	1	0	230000000	Eoraptor lunensis
	dinosaurs	2	0	170000000
	dinosaurs	3	2	145000000	Ceratosaurus nasicornis
	dinosaurs	4	2	71000000	Carnotaurus sastrei
	
In a PhyGeo project, the file that contains the trees is indicated with the
"trees" keyword.
