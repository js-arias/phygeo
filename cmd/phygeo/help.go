PhyGeo requires several files to read and process biogeographic data. To
reduce the burden of keeping track of many files, a single project file is
used to hold the reference of all files required in the analysis. This guide
explains the structure of the file, but most of the time, the best and most
secure way to edit or view this file is by using phygeo commands.

A project file is a tab-delimited file with the following fields:

	- dataset  for the kind of file
	- path     for the path of the file

Here is an example file:

	# phygeo project files
	dataset	path
	geomotion	geo-motion.tab
	pixprior	pix-prior.tab
	ranges	ranges.tab
	landscape	landscape.tab
	trees	trees.tab

The valid file types are:

- Plate motion models. Defined by the dataset keyword "geomotion". This file
  contains the plate motion model in the form of a tab-delimited file. The
  recommended way to add a plate motion model is by using the command
  'phygeo geo add'.
- Paleolandscape models. Defined by the dataset keyword "landscape". This file
  contains pixel values at different time stages in the form of a
  tab-delimited file. The recommended way to add a paleolandscape model is by
  using the command 'phygeo geo add'.
- Pixel prior values. Defined by the dataset keyword "pixprior". This file
  contains the values used for the pixel priors in the form of a
  tab-delimited file. The recommended way to add a pixel prior file is by
  using the command 'phygeo geo prior'.
- Time-calibrated trees. Defined by the dataset keyword "trees". This file
  contains one or more trees in the form of a tab-delimited file. The
  recommended way to add a tree file is by using the command
  'phygeo tree add'.
- Presence-absence pixels. Defined by the dataset keyword "points". This file
  contains the pixels that indicate the presence of one or more taxons in the
  form of a tab-delimited file. The recommended way to add a presence-absence
  file is by using the command 'phygeo range add'.
- Range models. Defined by the dataset keyword "ranges". This file contains
  the distribution range models of one or more taxons in the form of a
  tab-delimited file. The recommended way to add a presence-absence file is by
  using the command 'phygeo range add'.
