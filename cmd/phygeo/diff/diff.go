Pixel probability files are used in PhyGeo to store the particular probability
of a pixel in a node at a given time stage. In PhyGeo, the main usage of this
kind of file is as an input to build the reconstruction maps.

A pixel probability file is a tab-delimited file with the following columns:

	-tree     the name of the tree	
	-node     the ID of the node
	-age      the age of the time stage, in years
	-type     the type of the stored probability. It can be "log-like" for
	          log-likelihood values (for example, the output of the
	          "diff like" command), "freq" for the raw frequency of a
	          pixel, or "kde" for the smoothed frequency of a pixel (both
	          can be produced by the output of the "diff freq" command).
	-equator  the number of pixels in the equator of the pixelation
	-pixel    the ID of the pixel (from the pixelation)
	-value    the probability value of the pixel.

The file can also include the following columns:

	-lambda  in the log-like files, this column indicates the lambda value
	         used for the likelihood calculations.

Here are some example files:
